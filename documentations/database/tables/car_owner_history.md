# `car_owner_history` Table

The `car_owner_history` table tracks ownership history of vehicles.
Each record represents a historical relationship between a car and a client, preserving past ownership even if the car.client_id changes later.
This enables a full audit trail of who has owned or been associated with each vehicle over time.

## Relationship

- **This table acts as a historical log** â€” unlike `car.client_id`, which only represents the current owner, this table preserves all past owners over time.

## Notes

- This table is essential for audits, resale tracking, and understanding long-term car history.
- Use this in conjunction with `car.client_id` to distinguish between current and past ownership.
